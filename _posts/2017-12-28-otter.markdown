# REWARD: $5,000,000,000,000.00
<br />
A week ago we lost our beloved otter. There has been speculation that Oscarelli killed her and hid the body or that Cassie's mom fell in love at first site and stole her on Christmas. We don't judge and we don't care what happened... we are willing to forgive whatever actually happened we just want our otter back please!

If anyone has any information that leads to the safe return of our beloved otter we will pay the reward posted above no questions asked.
